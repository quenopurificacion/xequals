# Xequals Front end challenge. 

Basically we would like you demonstrate your front end skills by styling the HTML in this repo to the the provided design.
The HTML has been taken from a Drupal site so it may have attributes and tags you are not familiar with. We would also like you to share it with us on Git.

Requirements.

1. Download this Git repo.
2. Use sass for the styling. 
3. Create a Front End build system with Node to compile the sass files to css. Use grunt, gulp or parcel.
4. When finished, send us a link to a repo we can download and check out your work.


Other Points
1. You shouldn't have to change the HTML so only use CSS to style. Apart from:
   In the HTML file, I've added CSS for a background colour to the header so that the logo is visible, and a background image for the header and footer, so you can remove these if you like.
2. You can change the file structure of the project however you like. 
3. You can use JavaScript for the mobile menu if you wish. 
5. There's only 1 breakpoint in the design, Mobile < 600px.
6. There are placeholder images which you can leave or change if you wish.


We want to see how you set up a front end, your best sass/css practices and how you make a design into a finished website. This includes, colours, fonts and layout but you don't have to replicate the images.
